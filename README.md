# BayAreaTransitRoutes
An app for riders of public transportation.
Uses Google's Directions API and various APIs from 511Transit.org.
Allows a user to enter an origin (or use location services) and destination and choose a route.
The app then shows a polyline on a map (using Google Maps SDK for iOS) of the chosen route.
The app also shows a marker at the current location of the user's transit vehicle (primarily for buses) and displays the distance
of the bus from the stop where the user will board the vehicle.
